What if your script had to accept numbers in the trillions?  Describe, but don’t 
implement, how you would attempt to generalize your code so that you didn’t have 
to have 50 if statements.


Well first thing i would do is search cpan and use a module i found called Lingua::EN::Numbers.
It converts numbers to words no matter how large the number is.  Since im sure we were not allowed
to use this i had some ideas on how to get my code to do it but it was just more if statements.
I made a hash of postfixs that went up to hundred million, but the issue was the single or plural saying
of the first number.  After the 2nd digit every 3 is a plural form like twenty thirty and so on.  I was
attempting to make a big if statement that looked like if($digit == 5 | $digit == 8 | $digit == 11) and so on
but it did not even up working the way i wanted it to so i removed it.  The only way i can think this would work is
a more cleaver hash table and some kind of statement that every third digit after 2 was plural form of the number
otherwise single.
